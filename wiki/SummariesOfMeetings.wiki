== Second meeting (04/23/2007) ==

=== Accomplished ===

  * Helder: Tried playing around with Firewatir on Gmail to delete all messages with a label. Failed miserably. Learned a few things.
  * Helder: Installed DOM Inspector, Web Developer and InspectWidget extensions; started fussing around with pages structures.
  * Angrez/Aaron: Tried out TestGen4Web and looked at his output.
    * it doesn't write out reload command when user clicks on Back button;
    * it doesn't handle page pop ups. probably would have to record new script for new window and then merge it into the parent one;
    * don't know if it handles javascript popups (messages).

=== Decisions ===

  * Ruled out selenium-ide as candidate for recorder.
  * Meetings should be weekly until the end of May (because of Helder's work and university classes), and then start to be twice a week as we build up speed.

=== TODO ===

  * Helder: Write script to empty Gmail-*HTML* label (should be easier).
  * Helder: Go through roadmap in the application and sketch out Milestones.
  * Everyone: Search for new recorders. *Deadline* for picking one is _next week_.
